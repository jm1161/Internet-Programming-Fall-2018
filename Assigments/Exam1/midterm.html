<h1>Midterm</h1>

<div class="subtitle">Everybody get excited!</div>

<p>If you're reading this, you already successfully checked out the midterm. Woohoo! Have a point. Not, like, a real one.</p>

<p>Rules and Guidelines</p>
<ul>
  <li>You may use any resources except other people. Old assignments are fine. Google is fine.</li>
  <li>You <strong>may not</strong> copy and paste code off the internet. Write it yourself, in your own way.</li>
  <li>You <strong>must</strong> use jQuery functionality, not vanilla JavaScript equivalents.</li>
  <li>You'll need XAMPP for the AJAX-related questions.</li>
  <li>Get your browser tools up, you're going to need them.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm providing the midterm.html, midterm.js and midterm.css files. JavaScript must go in the .js file, and style rules in the .css file.</lp>

<h4>Commit Often.</h4>

<h2>Question 1, CSS (5 points)</h2>

<p>a. Without adding to the html page, make the title at the top ("Midterm") centered, blue and change the font to Courier New.</p>

<p id="greenBorder">b. Adding only an id attribute to the html page, put a thin green border (rectangle) around this sentence.</p>

<p>c. Adding only a class attribute to the html page, make the subtitle at the top ("Everybody get excited!") centered, italic and red.</p>

<h2>Question 2, JavaScript Warmup (10 points)</h2>

<p>a. When the button below is clicked, change the text on it to "Ouch!"</p>

<div><button id="button1">Click me!</button></div>

<p>b. When the button below is clicked, add another item to the list (descending).</p>

<ul id="list1">
  <li>99 bottles of beer on the wall...</li>
  <li>98 bottles of beer on the wall...</li>
</ul>

<div><button id="button2">One more!</button></div>

<p>c. Temperature conversion! When the user types a number in either
box below, make the corresponding value appear in the other box. (Yes,
you should look up the formula. And you can assume they type numbers only.)</p>

<div><input id="convertIn" type="text">&#176;C =&gt; <input id="convertOut" type="text"> &#176;F</div>

<h2>Question 3, JavaScript (10 points)</h2>

<p>Look, I made a whack-a-mole game! Except it stinks. Make me less
  sad by fixing it.</p>

<p>I used the cool <em>setTimeout</em> method to make them pop up on a
  timer, except I think I did it wrong. 1-3 moles should pop up at
  random every 0.5 seconds, and stay up for 1 second before
  disappearing. You start with 0 points and get 10 points for clicking
  on a mole before it disappears (score displayed at bottom of game).</p>

<p>Bonus point if you animate the appearing and disappearing.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="whack" src="mole.jpg"></td>
    <td><img class="whack" src="mole.jpg"></td>
    <td><img class="whack" src="mole.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="whack" src="mole.jpg"></td>
    <td><img class="whack" src="mole.jpg"></td>
    <td><img class="whack" src="mole.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img class="whack" src="mole.jpg"></td>
    <td><img class="whack" src="mole.jpg"></td>
    <td><img class="whack" src="mole.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td id="score" colspan="3">5000000 Points</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Question 4, AJAX (10 points)</h2>

<p>In the included <em>instructors.js</em> file there is a JSON array
of information about various CS instructors. But let's be real, all
that matters is how awesome they are. Make it so that when you click
the button below, the page makes an AJAX call to retrieve that file
(you'll need to be running through XAMPP) and displays each instructor
name and how awesome they are as <em>list items</em> in the list below
(just like Example Guy). You can only alter this file to add ids or
classes, the rest of your answer should be in the js file.</p>

<h4>How Awesome Are They?</h4>
<button id="button3">Show me.</button>
<ul id="list2">
  <li>Example Guy: Not Awesome.</li>
</ul>
